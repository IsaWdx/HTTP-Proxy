Here are the commands which we tested your proxy server with.
For curl, it should produce the same result from your proxy
as the direct connection. Example:

curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html > actual
curl -0 -x localhost:8000 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html > proxied
diff actual proxied

diff will output nothing if the files are identical, in which case you
pass the test case.

Test Cases
----------
1. Handling small file and images (2 marks)
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html (1)
curl -0 http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/img/doge.jpg (1)

2. Handling complex webpages (2 marks)
wget www.comp.nus.edu.sg (2)
wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080 -p http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/

wget download the entire site into a directory structure.
So run wget in two different directories then diff the two directories.

3. Handling large file (2 marks)
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/a1/large.mp4 (2)
The md5sum of large.mp4 should match. Just like in assignment 0.

4. Handling 404 and 502 error messages
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/notfound.html (1)
curl -0 www.ccc.nus.edu.sg/ (1)
We check if the correct 502 status code is in the HTTP response.

5. Handle POST
curl -0 --data "name=Peter&city=Singapore" http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/demo_test_post.asp  (2)

6. Handle custom port
curl -0 portquiz.net:1234/  (1)

7. Normal caching
8. Adv caching
We used our custom web server to test for this. So it is not possible for you 
to replicate our test.

9. Text censoring
curl -0 http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/sherlock.txt
words in censor.txt: Adler, Watson (1)
words in censor.txt: quite, then, peculiar (1)

10. Multi-threading
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/a1/large.mp4 +
curl -0 www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2105/demo.html (2)

Open two windows, and with one request large.mp4 and while large.mp4 is downloading,
request for demo.html in the other. If your proxy supports multi-threading, then 
demo.html will be downloaded before large.mp4 completes.
